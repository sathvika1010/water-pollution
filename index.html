        <h2 style="font-size:30px;">Introduction to Water Pollution</h2>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">
            Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies like rivers, lakes, and oceans due to harmful substances. It can be caused by various pollutants including chemicals from industrial discharge, agricultural runoff containing pesticides, untreated sewage, and plastic debris. Pollutants are categorized into chemical (e.g., heavy metals), biological (e.g., bacteria), physical (e.g., plastic waste), and thermal (e.g., heated water). The effects of water pollution are severe, impacting ecosystems by harming aquatic life, and posing health risks to humans, such as gastrointestinal diseases and long-term illnesses from toxic chemicals. Economically, it affects industries reliant on clean water and increases treatment costs. Solutions include implementing regulations, improving waste management, using advanced treatment technologies, and promoting public awareness. Conservation efforts and education are essential in addressing and mitigating the impact of water pollution.
